    `location` is a Hyperdiv component that gives access to the
    browser's location bar.  Using `location`, you can render
    different things for different location paths, query args, and
    hash args.

    `location` offers three props: `path`, `query_args`, and `hash_arg`.

    If the browser location is `https://my-app.com/foo/bar?a=1&b=2#hello`, then:

    * `location().protocol == "https:"`
    * `location().host == "my-app.com"`
    * `location().path == "/foo/bar"`
    * `location().query_args == "a=1&b=2"`
    * `location().hash_arg == "hello"`

    You can change the location by using the `go()` method. For
    example, to change the location to `"/foo/bar"`, you can call
    `location().go(path="/foo/bar")`.

    Changing the location by using `go()` or mutating the location
    props is useful in some cases, but in general is an anti-pattern
    and you should instead use @component(link)s to implement
    navigation.
